# Assignment: Exploring Strings and Basic Operations in Python

Objective:
To understand fundamental concepts of string manipulation, quoting, and basic operations in Python.

Tasks:

1. String Quoting:
Create three variables: single_quote, double_quote, and triple_quote.
Assign a string to each variable using single quotes (''), double quotes (""), and triple quotes (''' '''), respectively.
Print each variable.

2. String Escaping:
Create a variable escaped_string containing a string with an apostrophe (') using an escape character.
Print the escaped_string.

3. Type Conversion and Casting:
Create variables num_string and num_int.
Assign a string representing a number to num_string.
Use type conversion to convert num_string to an integer and assign it to num_int.
Print both num_string and num_int.

4, Input and Concatenation:
Prompt the user to enter their first name using the input() function. Store the input in a variable called first_name.
Prompt the user to enter their last name using the input() function. Store the input in a variable called last_name.
Concatenate first_name and last_name to create a full name and store it in a variable called full_name.
Print full_name.

Using f-strings:
Create variables age and city.
Assign your age to age and your city to city.
Use an f-string to print a sentence that includes your age and city.

String Manipulation:
Create a variable sentence containing any sentence you like.
Use string manipulation to convert sentence to uppercase and store it in a variable called upper_sentence.
Print upper_sentence.
