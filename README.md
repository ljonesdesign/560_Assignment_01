# Assignment: Exploring Strings and Basic Operations in Python

## Objective:

To understand fundamental concepts of string manipulation, quoting, and basic operations in Python.

## Tasks:

### 1. String Quoting:

Create three strings with the print function. The first string should use single_quote, the second should use double_quote, and third should use triple_quote.
Include a sentence in each which makes sense to use each particular type of quotations.

### 2. String Escaping:

Create a variable which is a string with a sentence which contains an apostrophe. Use single quotations to enclose the string. Escape the (') using an escape character.
Print the escaped_string.

### 3. Type Conversion and Casting:

Create variables num_string and num_int.
Assign a string representing a number to num_string.
Use type conversion to convert num_string to an integer and assign it to num_int.
Print both num_string and num_int.

### 4. Input and Concatenation:

Prompt the user to enter their first name using the input() function. Store the input in a variable called first_name.
Prompt the user to enter their last name using the input() function. Store the input in a variable called last_name.
Concatenate first_name and last_name to create a full name and store it in a variable called full_name.
Print full_name.

### 5. Using f-strings:

Create two variables with two different variable names.
Assign one word to one variable and another word to the other variable 
Use an f-string to print a sentence that includes these two variables.

### 6. Math:

Create a program which asks your user to input three different `int` numbers. (We won't worry with validating the numbers to ensure they are unique-yet) Store each `int` number as a variable. Write an expression which multiplies the first two numbers and then raises the product of those two numbers to the power of 2 (squares the number) then subtract the third number.

### 7. Formatting

Duplicate the previous task and make the numbers `floats` and then then print the result as currency.
