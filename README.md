# Assignment: Exploring Strings and Basic Operations in Python

Objective:
To understand fundamental concepts of string manipulation, quoting, and basic operations in Python.

Tasks:

    String Quoting:
        Create three variables: single_quote, double_quote, and triple_quote.
        Assign a string to each variable using single quotes (''), double quotes (""), and triple quotes (''' '''), respectively.
        Print each variable.

    String Escaping:
        Create a variable escaped_string containing a string with an apostrophe (') using an escape character.
        Print the escaped_string.

    Type Conversion and Casting:
        Create variables num_string and num_int.
        Assign a string representing a number to num_string.
        Use type conversion to convert num_string to an integer and assign it to num_int.
        Print both num_string and num_int.

    Input and Concatenation:
        Prompt the user to enter their first name using the input() function. Store the input in a variable called first_name.
        Prompt the user to enter their last name using the input() function. Store the input in a variable called last_name.
        Concatenate first_name and last_name to create a full name and store it in a variable called full_name.
        Print full_name.

    Using f-strings:
        Create variables age and city.
        Assign your age to age and your city to city.
        Use an f-string to print a sentence that includes your age and city.

    String Manipulation:
        Create a variable sentence containing any sentence you like.
        Use string manipulation to convert sentence to uppercase and store it in a variable called upper_sentence.
        Print upper_sentence.

    Checking Substrings:
        Create a variable word containing a word of your choice.
        Use the in keyword to check if a specific letter is present in word. Print the result.

Submission:

    Write Python code to complete the tasks above.
    Save your code in a Python file named string_operations.py.
    Submit the Python file via your preferred method.
