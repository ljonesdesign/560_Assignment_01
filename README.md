# Assignment: Exploring Strings and Basic Operations in Python

## Objective:

To understand fundamental concepts of string manipulation, quoting, and basic operations in Python.

## Tasks:

### 1. String Quoting:

Create three strings with the print function. The first string should use single_quotes, the second should use double_quotes, and third should use triple_quotes.
Include one sentence it the first two which makes sense to use each particular type of quotation set. It the case of the triple quote, use two or three sentences.

### 2. String Escaping:

Create a variable which is a sentence which contains an apostrophe (`str`). Use single quotations to enclose the string. Escape the (') using an escape character.
Print the escaped_string.

### 3. Type Conversion and Casting:

Create variables `num_string` and `num_int`.
Assign a string representing a number to `num_string`.
Use type conversion to convert `num_string` to an integer and assign it to `num_int`.
Print both `num_string` and `num_int`.

### 4. Input and Concatenation:

Prompt the user to enter their first name using the  `input()` function. Store the input in a variable called `first_name`.
Prompt the user to enter their last name using the `input()` function. Store the input in a variable called `last_name`.
Concatenate `first_name` and `last_name` to create a full name and store it in a variable called `full_name`.
Print full_name.

### 5. Using f-strings:

Create two variables with two different variable names.
Assign one word to one variable and another word to the other variable.
Use an f-string to print a sentence that includes these two variables.

### 6. Math:

Create a program which asks your user to input three different `int` numbers. (We won't worry with validating the numbers to ensure they are unique-yet) Store each `int` number as a variable. Write an expression which multiplies the first two numbers and then raises the product of those two numbers to the power of 2 (squares the number) then subtract the third number from the result of the previous operation.

### 7. Currency Formatting

Duplicate the previous task and make the numbers `floats` and then then print the result as currency. 

### 8. Demo the end parameter
Consider the following:
```
print('Some text and')
print('some other text.')
```

Add necessary `end` parameter(s) to make the output read as follows:
```
Some text and some other text.
```
### 9. Demo the sep parameter 
Print out this date with hyphens using the sep parameter.
```
print('01,'29','2024')
```
